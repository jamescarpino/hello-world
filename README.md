# hello-world
A program to say hello to the world.  This is my first Github, created following the tutrial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Some people might be alarmed that I didn't learn to use Github after being a programmer for so long.  Well, I did my work in a vacuum! That explains it.
